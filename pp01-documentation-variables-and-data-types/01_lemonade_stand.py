OPTIONAL AI GUIDANCE PROMPT:
----------------------------
I am a student in an introductory Python class. I am learning many coding
principles for the very first time. I am going to paste in the instructions to
a practice problem that my professor gave me to try before class. Please be my
kind tutor and walk me through how to solve the problem step by step.

Don't just give me the full solution all at once (unless I later ask for it).
Instead, help me work through it gradually, with clear explanations and small,
easy-to-understand examples. Please use everyday language and explain things
in a simple, friendly way.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------
You are starting a lemonade stand business! You want to keep track of how
many cups of lemonade you sold, how much you charge per cup, and how much
money you made in total.

1. Create a variable for the number of cups sold.
2. Create a variable for the price per cup.
3. Create a variable that stores the total revenue (cups sold * price).
4. Print out the total revenue using the print() function.
